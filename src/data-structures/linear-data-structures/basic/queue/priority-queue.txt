1. Overview:
A Priority Queue is a specialized data structure that allows elements to be served based on their priority. It is an abstract data type, similar to a queue or stack, but each element has an additional property: priority. Elements with a higher priority are dequeued before elements with lower priority.

2. Structures and Types:

2.1. Element: Each element in the Priority Queue should have two properties: 'value' which stores the actual data and 'priority' which determines the order of service.

2.2. Priority Queue: The Priority Queue itself should be a collection of 'Element' objects.

3. Operations:

3.1. Insert: This operation should add an 'Element' to the Priority Queue. If two elements have the same priority, they should be served according to their order in the queue.

3.2. Peek: This operation should return the 'Element' with the highest priority without removing it from the Priority Queue.

3.3. Remove: This operation should remove and return the 'Element' with the highest priority from the Priority Queue.

4. Constraints:

4.1. If the Priority Queue is empty, the 'Peek' and 'Remove' operations should return a specific value (e.g., null) or throw an exception.

4.2. The 'Insert', 'Peek', and 'Remove' operations should be performed in a reasonable time complexity.

5. Exception Handling:

5.1. Invalid Element: If an 'Element' with invalid 'value' or 'priority' is attempted to be inserted into the Priority Queue, an exception should be thrown.

5.2. Empty Queue: If 'Peek' or 'Remove' operations are performed on an empty Priority Queue, an exception should be thrown.

6. Optional Features:

6.1. Size: This operation returns the number of elements in the Priority Queue.

6.2. IsEmpty: This operation checks if the Priority Queue is empty.

6.3. Clear: This operation removes all elements from the Priority Queue.

7. Implementation Considerations:

7.1. The Priority Queue could be implemented using various underlying data structures such as an array, linked list, heap, etc.

7.2. The choice of underlying data structure will impact the time complexity of operations.

7.3. The 'priority' can be either lower value indicates higher priority or higher value indicates higher priority. It depends on the specific use case requirement.
