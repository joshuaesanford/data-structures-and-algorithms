1. Overview:
The circular queue is a linear data structure which follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle but unlike normal queues, the last element points to the first element making a circular link.

2. Requirements:
2.1. The circular queue data structure should have a maximum size N which is declared at the time of initialization.
2.2. It should have two pointers namely, FRONT and REAR which are initially set to -1 signifying an empty queue.
2.3. The data structure should be capable of holding any data type.

3. Operations:
3.1. Enqueue: This operation should add an element at the REAR end of the queue. If the REAR equals to the maximum size of the queue -1, it should wrap around to the start of the queue.
3.2. Dequeue: This operation should remove an element from the FRONT end of the queue. If the FRONT equals to the maximum size of the queue -1, it should wrap around to the start of the queue.
3.3. IsEmpty: This operation should check if the queue is empty (i.e., when FRONT equals REAR).
3.4. IsFull: This operation should check if the queue is full (i.e., when REAR is one position behind FRONT).
3.5. Peek: This operation should return the element at the FRONT without removing it from the queue.

4. Error Handling:
4.1. If an attempt is made to enqueue an element in a full queue, an appropriate error message should be returned.
4.2. Similarly, if an attempt is made to dequeue an element from an empty queue, an appropriate error message should be returned.

5. Efficiency Considerations:
5.1. The enqueue and dequeue operations should be performed in constant time, i.e., O(1).
5.2. The space complexity should be O(N), where N is the size of the queue.

6. Usage:
The circular queue data structure can be used in scenarios where resources are shared between multiple users/threads and are allocated in a cyclic manner, such as CPU scheduling, memory management, etc.
