1. Overview:
A Dequeue, also known as a double-ended queue, is a type of data structure that allows insertion and removal of elements from both ends. This specification outlines the methods and behaviors needed to implement a Dequeue within any general system.

2. Structure:
The Dequeue data structure should maintain pointers to both the head and tail of the queue, allowing for constant time operations at either end.

3. Methods/Operations:

3.1. insertFront(data): 
This method should insert an element at the front of the Dequeue. It should accept a single parameter, the data to be inserted, and return nothing. If the Dequeue is full, an error should be thrown or returned.

3.2. insertLast(data): 
This method should insert an element at the end of the Dequeue. It should accept a single parameter, the data to be inserted, and return nothing. If the Dequeue is full, an error should be thrown or returned.

3.3. deleteFront(): 
This method should remove and return the element at the front of the Dequeue. If the Dequeue is empty, an error should be thrown or returned.

3.4. deleteLast(): 
This method should remove and return the element at the end of the Dequeue. If the Dequeue is empty, an error should be thrown or returned.

3.5. getFront(): 
This method should return the element at the front of the Dequeue without removing it. If the Dequeue is empty, an error should be thrown or returned.

3.6. getRear(): 
This method should return the element at the end of the Dequeue without removing it. If the Dequeue is empty, an error should be thrown or returned.

3.7. isEmpty(): 
This method should return a boolean indicating whether the Dequeue is empty or not.

3.8. isFull():
This method should return a boolean indicating whether the Dequeue is full or not.

4. Error Handling:
The implementation should handle errors appropriately and ensure the data structure remains in a consistent state even when errors occur.

5. Performance:
The implementation of the Dequeue data structure should aim to make all operations as efficient as possible, ideally aiming for constant time complexity, O(1), for all operations.

6. Thread Safety:
If the Dequeue is expected to be used in a multi-threading environment, the implementation should ensure that it is thread-safe.
