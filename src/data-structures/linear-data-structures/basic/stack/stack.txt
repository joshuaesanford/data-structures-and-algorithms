1. Introduction:
The Stack Data Structure is a linear data structure that adheres to the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) method for accessing and manipulating data. This specification outlines the fundamental operations that should be supported by a Stack Data Structure.

2. Functional Requirements:

2.1 Data Storage:
The Stack should be able to store any type of data, be it integers, strings, floats, or objects. 

2.2 Push Operation:
The Stack should provide a "push" operation that inserts an element onto the top of the stack. If the stack is full and cannot accommodate new elements, the operation should throw an exception or return a failure status.

2.3 Pop Operation:
The Stack should provide a "pop" operation that removes and returns the top element of the stack. If the stack is empty and there are no elements to remove, the operation should throw an exception or return a failure status.

2.4 Peek/Top Operation:
The Stack should provide a "peek" or "top" operation that returns the top element of the stack without removing it. If the stack is empty and there are no elements, the operation should throw an exception or return a failure status.

2.5 IsEmpty Operation:
The Stack should provide an "isEmpty" operation that returns a boolean value indicating whether the stack is empty (true) or not (false).

2.6 Size Operation:
The Stack should provide a "size" operation that returns the current number of elements in the stack.

3. Non-Functional Requirements:

3.1 Efficiency:
The push and pop operations should ideally have a time complexity of O(1), meaning that the time it takes to perform these operations should be constant, regardless of the size of the stack.

3.2 Memory Usage:
The Stack should use memory efficiently, such that each element in the stack only stores its own data and the minimum necessary metadata (such as a reference to the next element).

3.3 Robustness:
The Stack should handle failures gracefully. If an operation cannot be completed due to an error condition (such as a full stack in a push operation or an empty stack in a pop operation), the stack should maintain its previous state and not lose any data.

4. Constraints:

4.1 The Stack should adhere strictly to the LIFO principle for all its operations.
4.2 The Stack should not allow access to elements other than the top element. This includes both direct access and iterative access to the elements.
4.3 The Stack should not expose its internal representation or allow its data to be manipulated outside of the provided operations.
