1. Overview
An Array is a fundamental data structure which contains elements of similar data types organized in a consecutive memory location. Each element in the array can be uniquely identified by its index.

2. Properties
Arrays are linear data structures, as they store elements in a sequential manner.

The array should have a fixed size, defined at the time of its creation.

Each element in the array should be of the same data type.

The elements of an array are stored in contiguous memory locations.

Elements in the array are identified by their index, which starts typically from zero.
