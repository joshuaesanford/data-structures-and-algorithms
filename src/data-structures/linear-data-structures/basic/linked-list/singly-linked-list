A singly linked list is a linear data structure composed of nodes where each node contains a data element and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. This allows for efficient insertions or removals from the list without reorganizing the entire data structure. 

1. Node Structure:
Each node of the singly linked list will contain two components:
   a. Data: This component will hold the data value. The data type can be any valid data type based on the implementation requirement.
   b. Next: This component is a pointer that points to the next node in the list. If it points to Null, then it is the last node in the list.

2. Head:
The head is a reference to the first node in the linked list. If the list is empty, then head is a null reference.

Characteristics:

1. Singly linked lists are dynamic, which means they can grow and shrink at runtime by allocating and deallocating memory.
2. There is no contiguous memory requirement as each node can reside anywhere in the memory and is linked to its next node via its ‘next’ pointer.
3. They do not have a fixed size and can extend up to all the available memory space.
4. Accessing an element in a singly linked list requires sequential access and hence, access to elements is slower compared to arrays.

Operations:

The following operations can be performed on a singly linked list:

1. Insertion: To add a new node in the list.
2. Deletion: To delete any node from the list.
3. Display: To display the contents of the list.
4. Search: To search for an element in the list.
5. Update: To update the value of an existing node.

This specification categorizes a singly linked list as a linear data structure because it maintains a linear order of elements where each element is connected to its previous and next element in a specific order. The elements are arranged sequentially and each element is connected to the next element via a pointer, which makes it a linear data structure.
