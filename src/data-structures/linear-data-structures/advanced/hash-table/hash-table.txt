1. Overview:
A Hash Table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Hash Tables support efficient search, insert and delete operations.

2. Data Components:
   - Key: The unique identifier used to identify a particular item in the hash table.
   - Value: The data associated with the key.
   - Hash Function: A function that generates a unique index for each unique key.
   - Buckets/Slots: The array of storage locations in the hash table.

3. Core Operations:
   - Insert(key, value): Stores the key-value pair in the hash table.
   - Get(key): Retrieves the value associated with the given key.
   - Delete(key): Removes the key-value pair specified by the key.
   - Contains(key): Checks if the given key exists in the hash table.

4. Structure:
   - The Hash Table should be implemented as an array of "buckets" or "slots", each of which can store one key-value pair.
   - The Hash function should ensure that keys are uniformly distributed over the array to prevent clustering and to achieve constant time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations.
   - In the event of a hash collision (where two keys produce the same hash), the Hash Table should implement a strategy such as chaining (where each bucket holds a linked list of all key-value pairs with the same hash) or open addressing (where alternate buckets are found for the colliding keys).

5. Features:
   - Size: A method that returns the number of key-value pairs in the hash table.
   - Load Factor: The number of keys stored in the hash table divided by the capacity. If the load factor exceeds a certain threshold, the hash table should be rehashed (i.e., create a new larger table and move all keys to the new table).
   - Rehash: A method to increase the capacity of the hash table and re-arrange all the existing key-value pairs.

6. Error Handling:
   - If a Get or Delete operation is attempted on a key that does not exist in the Hash Table, the operation should return a clear, concise error message.

7. Performance:
   - The Hash Table data structure should aim for O(1) time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations under typical conditions.
   - The worst-case time complexity should not exceed O(n), where n is the size of the Hash Table.

8. Constraints:
   - All keys in the Hash Table should be unique. If an Insert operation is attempted with a key that already exists in the Hash Table, the new value should replace the old value.
   - The Hash Table should be dynamic - it should be able to grow and shrink in size as key-value pairs are added or removed.
