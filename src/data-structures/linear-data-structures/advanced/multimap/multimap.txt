1. Overview:

A Multimap is a particular type of data structure that maps keys to values, similar to a Map. The key distinction between a Map and a Multimap is that a Multimap allows multiple values to be associated with a single key. This specification lays out the general requirements for implementing a Multimap data structure.

2. Structure:

2.1. The Multimap data structure will be a collection of key-value pairs where each key can be associated with multiple values.

2.2. The data structure will allow for insertion, deletion, and retrieval of key-value pairs.

3. Operations:

3.1. Insertion: The Multimap data structure will provide a method for inserting a key-value pair. If a key already exists in the Multimap, the new value will be added to the existing list of values without deleting or replacing the existing values.

3.2. Deletion: The Multimap data structure will provide a method to remove a specific key-value pair, a specific key and all associated values, or a specific value associated with a key.

3.3. Retrieval: The Multimap data structure will provide a method for retrieving all values associated with a specific key.

4. Key and Value Types:

4.1. The Multimap data structure should support any data type for keys and values, as defined by the system or programming language it is implemented in.

5. Iteration:

5.1. The Multimap data structure will provide a method to iterate over all key-value pairs, all keys, or all values.

6. Size:

6.1. The Multimap data structure will provide a method to return the total count of key-value pairs.

7. Performance:

7.1. The Multimap data structure should be optimized to provide fast insertion, deletion, and retrieval of key-value pairs.

8. Non-Requirement:

8.1. Order of key-value pairs or values for each key is not guaranteed.

9. Error Handling:

9.1. The Multimap data structure should provide clear error messages for invalid operations, such as trying to delete a non-existing key-value pair or retrieve values for a non-existing key.

10. Thread Safety:

10.1. If the Multimap data structure is intended to be used in a multithreaded environment, it should be designed to be thread-safe. Otherwise, this is not a requirement.
