1. Description:
A Multiset (also known as a bag) is an abstract data type that generalizes the concept of a set. It is a collection of elements similar to sets, but unlike sets, multiple occurrences of an element can be stored in it.

2. Structure:
- It allows elements to have duplicate occurrences, i.e., elements can be repeated.
- The order of elements does not matter in a multiset.
- It can contain any type of elements - integers, strings, floats, objects, etc.

3. Operations:

3.1 Insertion: 
- add(element): This operation is used to add an element to the multiset. If the element already exists, its count is incremented.

3.2 Deletion:
- remove(element): This operation is used to remove an element from the multiset. If the element occurs more than once, its count is decremented by one.

3.3 Query:
- count(element): This operation returns the number of occurrences of an element in the multiset. If the element does not exist, it returns 0.
- contains(element): This operation checks if the element exists in the multiset. It returns true if the element exists; otherwise, it returns false.
- size(): This operation returns the total number of elements (counting duplicates) in the multiset.
- isEmpty(): This operation checks if the multiset is empty. It returns true if there are no elements in the multiset; otherwise, it returns false.

3.4 Other operations:
- clear(): This operation removes all the elements from the multiset.
- toArray(): This operation returns an array of all elements in the multiset (including duplicates).

4. Constraints:
- All elements in the multiset should be of the same data type.

Note: The performance of these operations may vary depending on the implementation. For example, operations like add, remove, and count could be expected to perform in constant time in a hash-based implementation, but may require logarithmic time in a tree-based implementation.
